"""
Write a program that reads a postal code from the user and displays the name of the province in which
that postal code resides. Your program cannot include any if statements, loops or lists. As a result,
you will almost certainly want to use a dictionary to solve this problem.
Your program does not need to do any error checking. The user will always enter a 6-character postal
code that begins with one of the letters indicated in the previous table.
